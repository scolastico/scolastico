### Hi, I'm Joschua,
or also called scolastico. I love free open source software and would like to do my part to ensure that there is more of it. At the moment I am mostly working on the Disc0rd.exe project. A bot for the chat platform Discord that aims to replace and centralize most of the other bots. Otherwise you may also know me from other projects.

Among other things, I have written several SpigotMC plugins in my past and have already helped with many other projects. Apart from that, I'm a well-trained system integrator and have already set up one or the other server system.
